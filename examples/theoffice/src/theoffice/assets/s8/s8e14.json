Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?"},{"id":117,"person":"Kelly","line":"Why?"},{"id":118,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh, no big deal.

I just wanna know what they are."},{"id":126,"person":"Dwight","line":"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime."},{"id":127,"person":"Kevin","line":"Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape."},{"id":128,"person":"Dwight","line":"Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan."},{"id":129,"person":"Ryan","line":"What are the criteria for going?"},{"id":130,"person":"Dwight","line":"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness?

"},{"id":132,"person":"Dwight","line":"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?"},{"id":133,"person":"Andy","line":"Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that."},{"id":134,"person":"Stanley","line":"Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson."},{"id":135,"person":"Kevin","line":"Hey!"},{"id":136,"person":"Angela","line":"Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office."},{"id":137,"person":"Kelly","line":"Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch."},{"id":138,"person":"Angela","line":"My baby is not a monster!"},{"id":139,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hey.

I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered."},{"id":150,"person":"Andy","line":"Wha-"},{"id":151,"person":"Stanley","line":"If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice."},{"id":152,"person":"Andy","line":"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out."},{"id":153,"person":"Dwight","line":"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it."},{"id":154,"person":"Andy","line":"No. That is a ridiculous waste of time."},{"id":155,"person":"Kelly","line":"For you maybe."},{"id":156,"person":"Andy","line":"Five to six hours?"},{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":"Three to four hours."},{"id":158,"person":"Andy","line":"No no no no."},{"id":159,"person":"Dwight","line":"Two to three hours..."},{"id":160,"person":"Andy","line":"Nope."},{"id":161,"person":"Dwight","line":"Come up with a statement in the next hour...."},{"id":162,"person":"Andy","line":"Thirty minutes!"},{"id":163,"person":"Creed","line":"I'm out."}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":164,"person":"Pam","line":"Ok, read it back to me."},{"id":165,"person":"Jim","line":" Robert, great offer.

Works for me."},{"id":168,"person":"Jim","line":"Ok, sending."},{"id":169,"person":"Pam","line":"Well done.

What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving."}]},{"id":21,"lines":[{"id":174,"person":"Ryan","line":"You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there."},{"id":175,"person":"Andy","line":"Or both?"},{"id":176,"person":"Ryan","line":"Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks."},{"id":177,"person":"Andy","line":"Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that."},{"id":178,"person":"Dwight","line":"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat."}]},{"id":22,"lines":[{"id":179,"person":"Kevin","line":"Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again.

Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know."},{"id":181,"person":"Andy","line":"Thank you."},{"id":182,"person":"Kevin","line":"When do we leave?"},{"id":183,"person":"Andy","line":"Thank you."}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":184,"person":"Toby","line":"It has been a long, lonely winter."},{"id":185,"person":"Dwight","line":"Wow.

I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head."},{"id":194,"person":"Dwight","line":"You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality."},{"id":195,"person":"Erin","line":"Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go."},{"id":196,"person":"Andy","line":"Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in.."},{"id":197,"person":"Erin","line":"Really?

So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?"},{"id":257,"person":"Val","line":"Yeah, that's her."},{"id":258,"person":"Darryl","line":"She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?"},{"id":259,"person":"Val","line":" Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon."}]},{"id":34,"lines":[{"id":260,"person":"Darryl","line":"Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie."}]},{"id":35,"lines":[{"id":261,"person":"Dwight","line":"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene."}]},{"id":36,"lines":[{"id":262,"person":"Erin","line":"I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back."}]},{"id":37,"lines":[{"id":263,"person":"Dwight","line":"So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate."},{"id":264,"person":"Jim","line":"So, what is this special project?"},{"id":265,"person":"Dwight","line":"Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store."},{"id":266,"person":"Jim","line":"That sounds awesome."},{"id":267,"person":"Dwight","line":"It did, it did."},{"id":268,"person":"Ryan","line":"You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it."},{"id":269,"person":"Erin","line":"Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.  Oh, don't write it down unless you like it."},{"id":270,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh, I like it."},{"id":271,"person":"Ryan","line":"It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?"},{"id":272,"person":"Dwight","line":"No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store."},{"id":273,"person":"Ryan","line":"Right. Think different, from Apple."},{"id":274,"person":"Jim","line":"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?"},{"id":275,"person":"Dwight","line":" Yes. What are my expectations for the group?"}]},{"id":38,"lines":[{"id":276,"person":"Dwight","line":"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag."}]},{"id":39,"lines":[{"id":277,"person":"Kelly","line":"I don't know how I'm going to live here without you."},{"id":278,"person":"Ryan","line":"Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there."},{"id":279,"person":"Kelly","line":"Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you."},{"id":280,"person":"Ryan","line":"No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair."}]},{"id":40,"lines":[{"id":281,"person":"Pam","line":"Alright "},{"id":282,"person":"Jim","line":"Bye."},{"id":283,"person":"Pam","line":"Bye. Call me when you land."},{"id":284,"person":"Jim","line":"I will."},{"id":285,"person":"Andy","line":"Safe travels."},{"id":286,"person":"Erin","line":"Goodbye for a very very long time."},{"id":287,"person":"Andy","line":"Oh, K. It's only three weeks."}]},{"id":41,"lines":[{"id":288,"person":"Kathy","line":" All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me.
