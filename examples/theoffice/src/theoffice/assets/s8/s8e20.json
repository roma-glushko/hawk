Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out."},{"id":140,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician."},{"id":141,"person":"Jim","line":"Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup."},{"id":142,"person":"Nellie","line":" Oh."},{"id":143,"person":"Jim","line":"Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just..."},{"id":144,"person":"Nellie","line":"I see you've discovered Benjamin.

What kind of restaurant."},{"id":149,"person":"Jim","line":"Dwight!"},{"id":150,"person":"Nellie","line":"I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss.

These must be very painful memories."},{"id":152,"person":"Dwight","line":"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick."},{"id":153,"person":"Nellie","line":"Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this."},{"id":154,"person":"Jim","line":"No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or..."},{"id":155,"person":"Nellie","line":"God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this.

Yeah.  Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me."},{"id":161,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, okay. Okay, I will.

The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. "},{"id":180,"person":"Andy","line":"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life.  I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one."},{"id":181,"person":"Party guests","line":"No, pop it. Pop it!
