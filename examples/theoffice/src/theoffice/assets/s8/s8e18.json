He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever."},{"id":4,"person":"Angela","line":"So, he's alive."},{"id":5,"person":"Andy","line":"Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful."},{"id":6,"person":"Angela","line":"Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead."},{"id":7,"person":"Andy","line":"How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke  of good fortune and he is now in a better place."},{"id":8,"person":"Phyllis","line":"If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?"},{"id":9,"person":"Oscar","line":"You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. "}]},{"id":2,"lines":[{"id":10,"person":"Oscar","line":"When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure.  Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there.  Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride."}]},{"id":3,"lines":[{"id":11,"person":"Andy","line":"I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.

God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!"}]},{"id":6,"lines":[{"id":19,"person":"Dwight","line":" Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! "},{"id":20,"person":"Nellie","line":"Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP."},{"id":21,"person":"Robert California","line":"I am loving the chemistry between you two."},{"id":22,"person":"Nellie","line":"I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George."},{"id":23,"person":"Robert California","line":"I bet. I'm excited."},{"id":24,"person":"Nellie","line":"Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo."},{"id":25,"person":"Dwight","line":"Ah!"},{"id":26,"person":"Nellie","line":"I just made you look like the goat of Dover.

Little something from all of us. "},{"id":29,"person":"Dwight","line":" Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful.  Four!  Oh yeah!"},{"id":30,"person":"Nellie","line":"He doesn't even care."},{"id":31,"person":"Dwight","line":"Don't even care!"}]},{"id":7,"lines":[{"id":32,"person":"Jim","line":"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah."}]},{"id":8,"lines":[{"id":33,"person":"Darryl","line":" Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?"},{"id":34,"person":"Andy","line":"Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice."},{"id":35,"person":"Darryl","line":"I'll put you down for shortbreads."},{"id":36,"person":"Andy","line":"Damn it."},{"id":37,"person":"Toby","line":" Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?"},{"id":38,"person":"Darryl","line":"No. No."},{"id":39,"person":"Toby","line":"What?"},{"id":40,"person":"Darryl","line":"I been selling here for five years. This is my spot."},{"id":41,"person":"Toby","line":"You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop?  Or chess club, or?"},{"id":42,"person":"Darryl","line":"You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting."},{"id":43,"person":"Toby","line":"That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl."},{"id":44,"person":"Darryl","line":"OK, great."}]},{"id":9,"lines":[{"id":45,"person":"Darryl","line":" All I need is Kevin.

It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred."}]},{"id":11,"lines":[{"id":49,"person":"Erin","line":"Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her.  I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me."}]},{"id":12,"lines":[{"id":50,"person":"Irene","line":"When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all."},{"id":51,"person":"Erin","line":"Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida.

Your little finger."}]},{"id":14,"lines":[{"id":58,"person":"Darryl","line":" Would you like to buy some cookies?"},{"id":59,"person":"Kevin","line":"Cookies, eh?"}]},{"id":15,"lines":[{"id":60,"person":"Kevin","line":" Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth."}]},{"id":16,"lines":[{"id":61,"person":"Darryl","line":" It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev."},{"id":62,"person":"Kevin","line":"I know. But sometimes you still get a little something."},{"id":63,"person":"Toby","line":" Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin."},{"id":64,"person":"Darryl","line":"You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport."},{"id":65,"person":"Toby","line":"No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?"},{"id":66,"person":"Kevin","line":"I do."},{"id":67,"person":"Toby","line":"See?"},{"id":68,"person":"Darryl","line":"That doesn't mean anything.

You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers."},{"id":88,"person":"Jim","line":"Thank you."},{"id":89,"person":"Robert California","line":"But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim?  They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us."},{"id":90,"person":"Jim","line":"Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible."},{"id":91,"person":"Robert California","line":"I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight."},{"id":92,"person":"Dwight","line":" Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!"},{"id":93,"person":"Robert California","line":" Bravo, Dwight! Very good!   Shame."}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":94,"person":"Dwight","line":" The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre   to the power of two."},{"id":95,"person":"Nellie","line":"How did that look?"},{"id":96,"person":"Gabe","line":"I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen."},{"id":97,"person":"Dwight","line":" I told you."},{"id":98,"person":"Todd Packer","line":"When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works.  You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-"},{"id":99,"person":"Dwight","line":"You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper."},{"id":100,"person":"Jim","line":" All right. There he is."},{"id":101,"person":"Dwight","line":"What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?"},{"id":102,"person":"Jim","line":"Can I just talk to you for one quick second?"},{"id":103,"person":"Dwight","line":"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? "},{"id":104,"person":"Jim","line":"Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- "},{"id":105,"person":"Dwight","line":"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. "},{"id":106,"person":"Todd Packer","line":"Nice.

I have a plane to catch."}]},{"id":21,"lines":[{"id":115,"person":"Erin","line":"Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy."},{"id":116,"person":"Irene","line":"Just open the program and type in his user name."},{"id":117,"person":"Erin","line":"Can you just do it?"},{"id":118,"person":"Irene","line":" Here, type in your password."},{"id":119,"person":"Erin","line":"'Erin123'"},{"id":120,"person":"Irene","line":"That's a terrible password.

You have to stop Dwight from doing this."},{"id":128,"person":"Jim","line":"I tried. He will not listen."},{"id":129,"person":"Pam","line":"Did you actually try your hardest?"},{"id":130,"person":"Jim","line":"Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up."},{"id":131,"person":"Stanley","line":"Don't talk to me."},{"id":132,"person":"Jim","line":"Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up."},{"id":133,"person":"Pam","line":"If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do."},{"id":134,"person":"Jim","line":"OK. All right."}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":135,"person":"Darryl","line":" What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago."},{"id":136,"person":"Phyllis","line":" Yeah."},{"id":137,"person":"Kevin","line":"That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model."},{"id":138,"person":"Darryl","line":"Thank you."},{"id":139,"person":"Toby","line":"I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life."},{"id":140,"person":"Darryl","line":"Look, I need this.

"}]},{"id":24,"lines":[{"id":142,"person":"Darryl","line":"Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun."}]},{"id":25,"lines":[{"id":143,"person":"Kelly","line":" Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things."},{"id":144,"person":"Pam","line":"Or have them sing that song!
