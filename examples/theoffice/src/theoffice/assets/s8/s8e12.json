The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, s*x, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room.  Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?"},{"id":27,"person":"Jim","line":"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke."},{"id":28,"person":"Robert","line":"What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?"},{"id":29,"person":"Jim","line":"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing."},{"id":30,"person":"Robert","line":"Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it."},{"id":31,"person":"Andy","line":"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here."},{"id":32,"person":"Robert","line":"A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home.

Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it."},{"id":38,"person":"Robert","line":"You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food."},{"id":39,"person":"Kevin","line":"Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?"},{"id":40,"person":"Oscar","line":"That was you, Kevin."},{"id":41,"person":"Kevin","line":"It was me."}]},{"id":11,"lines":[{"id":42,"person":"Meredith","line":"You going tonight, kiddo?

Come on."}]},{"id":12,"lines":[{"id":50,"person":"Erin","line":"Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.

They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine."}]},{"id":15,"lines":[{"id":61,"person":"Jim","line":"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second.

Great mileage."},{"id":78,"person":"Erin","line":"Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?"},{"id":79,"person":"Andy","line":"Well, I can't.
