That's not-- sorry."},{"id":159,"person":"Robert","line":"Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it.

No, that wasn't bad."},{"id":170,"person":"Robert","line":"My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin.
