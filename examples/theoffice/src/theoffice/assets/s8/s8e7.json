There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman."},{"id":89,"person":"Phyllis","line":"No we're not."},{"id":90,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right.

Do you think she's hot?"},{"id":123,"person":"Jim","line":"Nope."},{"id":124,"person":"Pam","line":"I'm not asking if you're in to her.

Uh, I don't. So are we good? "},{"id":131,"person":"Dwight","line":"That's just absurd."},{"id":132,"person":"Pam","line":"Yes, because she's hot, right?"},{"id":133,"person":"Dwight","line":"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on."}]},{"id":13,"lines":[{"id":134,"person":"Pam","line":"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth."}]},{"id":14,"lines":[{"id":135,"person":"Pam","line":"Dwight, am I hot right now?"},{"id":136,"person":"Dwight","line":"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction."},{"id":137,"person":"Pam","line":"What about before? Was I attractive before?"},{"id":138,"person":"Dwight","line":"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low."},{"id":139,"person":"Pam","line":"Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy."},{"id":140,"person":"Dwight","line":"You think Jim's lying?  That's so cute.

I never touch a pregnant woman."},{"id":143,"person":"Pam","line":"Yep, that's the Dwight I need."},{"id":144,"person":"Dwight","line":"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules."},{"id":145,"person":"Pam","line":"Okay."},{"id":146,"person":"Dwight","line":"Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth."},{"id":147,"person":"Pam","line":"I think so. Okay."},{"id":148,"person":"Dwight","line":"Rule two: we stop at nothing."},{"id":149,"person":"Pam","line":"Well, what does that... is that... okay."},{"id":150,"person":"Dwight","line":"Rule three: Don't fall in love."},{"id":151,"person":"Pam","line":"Yep, good."}]},{"id":15,"lines":[{"id":152,"person":"Dwight","line":"We're gonna bust this guy."},{"id":153,"person":"Pam","line":"Honesty is very important to me."},{"id":154,"person":"Dwight","line":"So important.

You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam."},{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":"None taken. What do you got?"},{"id":158,"person":"Kelly","line":"It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot."},{"id":159,"person":"Pam","line":"Hmm."}]},{"id":17,"lines":[{"id":160,"person":"Robert","line":" Hey, you found us!"},{"id":161,"person":"Curtis","line":"You guys sound great, man."},{"id":162,"person":"Robert","line":"Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding."},{"id":163,"person":"Darryl","line":"Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead."},{"id":164,"person":"Kevin","line":" Dude, you're on TV!

Okay, this is awesome."},{"id":172,"person":"Robert","line":"What should we play?"},{"id":173,"person":"Kevin","line":"Maybe we should warm up with some scales?"},{"id":174,"person":"Robert","line":"Midnight Rambler?"},{"id":175,"person":"Curtis","line":"Yeah."},{"id":176,"person":"Andy","line":"Midnight what?"},{"id":177,"person":"Curtis","line":" Have you heard about the midnight rambler?  Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!"}]},{"id":18,"lines":[{"id":178,"person":"Pam","line":"Hey, I was talking to Cathy.

Any ideas?"},{"id":181,"person":"Jim","line":"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets."},{"id":182,"person":"Pam","line":"Mike Tibbets, really?"},{"id":183,"person":"Jim","line":"Mm-hmm."},{"id":184,"person":"Ryan","line":"Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?"},{"id":185,"person":"Jim","line":"Not his mom's car."},{"id":186,"person":"Ryan","line":"Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z."},{"id":187,"person":"Jim","line":"Touche?"}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":188,"person":"Kelly","line":" Eww!"},{"id":189,"person":"Pam","line":"Kelly, calm down."},{"id":190,"person":"Kelly","line":"I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs."},{"id":191,"person":"Pam","line":"I don't think Jim cares about his hair."},{"id":192,"person":"Kelly","line":"Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person."},{"id":193,"person":"Dwight","line":"I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer."},{"id":194,"person":"Pam","line":"Jim's on to me."},{"id":195,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hmm?"},{"id":196,"person":"Pam","line":"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it."},{"id":197,"person":"Dwight","line":"Just ugly enough to have deniability."},{"id":198,"person":"Pam","line":"Yep."}]},{"id":20,"lines":[{"id":199,"person":"Jim","line":"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy."}]},{"id":21,"lines":[{"id":200,"person":"Dwight","line":"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body."},{"id":201,"person":"Kelly","line":"I'm gonna write something mean on his wall."},{"id":202,"person":"Pam","line":"No, Kelly, don't."},{"id":203,"person":"Dwight","line":"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there."},{"id":204,"person":"Pam and Kelly","line":"With the crotch?"},{"id":205,"person":"Dwight","line":"With the crotch."}]},{"id":22,"lines":[{"id":206,"person":"Kevin","line":" Whoo!"}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":207,"person":"Dwight","line":"Psst.

It's unnaturally sunken.  Busted. He just was mirroring.

Why?"},{"id":228,"person":"Dwight","line":"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance."},{"id":229,"person":"Jim","line":"Leave."},{"id":230,"person":"Dwight","line":" Does your husband have very soft erections?

But maybe that's where we are now."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":247,"person":"Dwight","line":"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test.
