Thank you."},{"id":100,"person":"Andy","line":"And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is."},{"id":101,"person":"Robert","line":"What is this?"},{"id":102,"person":"Andy","line":"It's a photocopy from your notebook."},{"id":103,"person":"Robert","line":"You read my notebook?

It's a doodle."},{"id":106,"person":"Andy","line":"What?"},{"id":107,"person":"Robert","line":"Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don't you think? Well, I doodle too, but I'm not an artist. So I draw words and lists."},{"id":108,"person":"Andy","line":"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?"},{"id":109,"person":"Robert","line":"Might as well have been sketching a cube."}]},{"id":29,"lines":[{"id":110,"person":"Andy","line":"Okay.

It's alphabetical."},{"id":119,"person":"Everyone","line":" No."},{"id":120,"person":"Dwight","line":"No, it's not. Here's how we find out.

You need at least one other element for it to be a party."},{"id":152,"person":"Andy","line":"Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?"},{"id":153,"person":"Stanley","line":"What's that?"},{"id":154,"person":"Andy","line":"Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese."},{"id":155,"person":"Stanley","line":"That's pizza."},{"id":156,"person":"Pam","line":"That's regular pizza."}]},{"id":32,"lines":[{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":"You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?"},{"id":158,"person":"Robert","line":"I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you."},{"id":159,"person":"Dwight","line":"Okay!"},{"id":160,"person":"Everyone","line":" Awww."},{"id":161,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Well, what about the other guys."},{"id":162,"person":"Dwight","line":"Losers."},{"id":163,"person":"Robert","line":"No."},{"id":164,"person":"Dwight","line":"C'mon."},{"id":165,"person":"Robert","line":"I don't- I don't wanna say-"},{"id":166,"person":"Dwight","line":"C'mon, c'mon."},{"id":167,"person":"Robert","line":"No, no."},{"id":168,"person":"Dwight","line":"C'mon."},{"id":169,"person":"Robert","line":"Ha, I guess I think they're losers."},{"id":170,"person":"Dwight","line":"Ha ha, I knew it!

Can you clarify that?"},{"id":195,"person":"Robert","line":"Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I'll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If I didn't, I don't. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong."},{"id":196,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Whew, well.
