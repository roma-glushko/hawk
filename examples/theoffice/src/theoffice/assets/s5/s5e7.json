I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate."},{"id":310,"person":"Kelly","line":"What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this."},{"id":311,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh, come on.

Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened."},{"id":318,"person":"Kelly","line":"OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends."},{"id":319,"person":"Dwight","line":"We have our confession. I'm calling security. "},{"id":320,"person":"Michael","line":"Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people."},{"id":321,"person":"Kelly","line":"See? I wasn't lying."},{"id":322,"person":"Michael","line":"You were lying."},{"id":323,"person":"Kelly","line":"I was lying."},{"id":324,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes.

I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?"},{"id":328,"person":"Kelly","line":"No problem."},{"id":329,"person":"Michael","line":"I think you should do that.

Who's Chuck Close?"},{"id":336,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work."},{"id":337,"person":"Alex","line":"Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?"},{"id":338,"person":"Pam","line":"OK."},{"id":339,"person":"Jim","line":"That's it. I want to talk to this guy.

He is into you."},{"id":345,"person":"Alex","line":"Why did you come to New York in the first place?"},{"id":346,"person":"Pam","line":"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too."},{"id":347,"person":"Alex","line":"Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it."},{"id":348,"person":"Pam","line":"Jim's in Scranton."},{"id":349,"person":"Alex","line":"I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway ... I will see you tomorrow."},{"id":350,"person":"Pam","line":"I'll see you tomorrow."},{"id":351,"person":"Alex","line":"OK.
