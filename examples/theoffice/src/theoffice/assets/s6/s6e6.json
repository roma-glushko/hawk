He's got to stand up to this mafia guy."},{"id":290,"person":"Andy","line":"Well I don't see that happening."},{"id":291,"person":"Dwight","line":"Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?"},{"id":292,"person":"Andy","line":"Are you saying-"},{"id":293,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yeah..."},{"id":294,"person":"Andy","line":"That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?"},{"id":295,"person":"Dwight","line":"What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!"},{"id":296,"person":"Andy","line":"That seems a little far-fetched."},{"id":297,"person":"Dwight","line":"Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened."}]},{"id":27,"lines":[{"id":298,"person":"Dwight","line":"Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean."},{"id":299,"person":"Michael","line":"No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works."},{"id":300,"person":"Andy","line":"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean."},{"id":301,"person":"Dwight","line":"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really."},{"id":302,"person":"Andy","line":"Class act. Boy scout."},{"id":303,"person":"Michael","line":"But Grotti acts like he's mafia though."},{"id":304,"person":"Andy","line":"He's trying to intimidate you to close sales.

I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden."}]},{"id":29,"lines":[{"id":307,"person":"Grotti","line":"This is Grotti."},{"id":308,"person":"Michael","line":"This is Scott."},{"id":309,"person":"Grotti","line":"Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now."},{"id":310,"person":"Michael","line":"Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?"},{"id":311,"person":"Grotti","line":"I, I thought you'd be pleased."},{"id":312,"person":"Michael","line":"Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd."},{"id":313,"person":"Grotti","line":"What?"},{"id":314,"person":"Michael","line":"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance."},{"id":315,"person":"Grotti","line":"I don't get it. How was I scaring you?"},{"id":316,"person":"Michael","line":"I think you knew exactly what you were doing.

Okay."},{"id":318,"person":"Michael","line":"You suck!"},{"id":319,"person":"Dwight","line":"Okay that's-"},{"id":320,"person":"Michael","line":"And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance."},{"id":321,"person":"Dwight","line":"That's good, let's wrap it up."},{"id":322,"person":"Michael","line":"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?"},{"id":323,"person":"Grotti","line":"Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?"},{"id":324,"person":"Michael","line":"Doubt it. "},{"id":325,"person":"Dwight and Andy","line":" Oh man."},{"id":326,"person":"Michael","line":"What a tool.  What?"},{"id":327,"person":"Andy","line":"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!"},{"id":328,"person":"Michael","line":"No. What do you mean?"},{"id":329,"person":"Dwight","line":"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared."},{"id":330,"person":"Michael","line":"What?"},{"id":331,"person":"Dwight","line":"You successfully backed down the mob!"},{"id":332,"person":"Andy","line":"You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!"},{"id":333,"person":"Michael","line":"Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not."}]},{"id":30,"lines":[{"id":334,"person":"Michael","line":"So I looked him in the eye and I said, \"Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day.
