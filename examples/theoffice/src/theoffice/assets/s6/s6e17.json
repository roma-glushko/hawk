Okay."}]},{"id":2,"lines":[{"id":7,"person":"Dwight","line":"I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.

I still have time."}]},{"id":6,"lines":[{"id":17,"person":"Pam","line":"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.

We have plenty of time."},{"id":36,"person":"Nick","line":"Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music."},{"id":37,"person":"Michael","line":"Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say.

Pam, please."},{"id":49,"person":"Pam","line":"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight."},{"id":50,"person":"Andy","line":"Yeah, no, you really should.

While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?"},{"id":59,"person":"Pam","line":"Not until midnight."},{"id":60,"person":"Andy","line":"Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds."},{"id":61,"person":"Erin","line":"I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr."},{"id":62,"person":"Andy","line":"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book."},{"id":63,"person":"Jim","line":"You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet."},{"id":64,"person":"Michael","line":"No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore."},{"id":65,"person":"Jim","line":" Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals."},{"id":66,"person":"Pam","line":"Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it."},{"id":67,"person":"Michael","line":"Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!"}]},{"id":13,"lines":[{"id":68,"person":"Michael","line":"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.
