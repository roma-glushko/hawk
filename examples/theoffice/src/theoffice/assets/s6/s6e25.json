I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. "}]},{"id":3,"lines":[{"id":3,"person":"Michael","line":"Pfffffttt."},{"id":4,"person":"Toby","line":"Come on, Michael.
