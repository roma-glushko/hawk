To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early.

Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to."},{"id":265,"person":"Alan","line":"Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions."},{"id":266,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yeah."}]}]}
