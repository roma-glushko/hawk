Take it up with the chief of police."},{"id":193,"person":"Angela","line":"You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy?

Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important.

I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension."},{"id":211,"person":"Pam","line":"I don't think an apology is enough.
