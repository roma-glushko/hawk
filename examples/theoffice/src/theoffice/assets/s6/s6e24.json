I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job.

No, she didn't say that."},{"id":154,"person":"Dwight","line":"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was,  \"What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.\" And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym.
