I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year."}]},{"id":8,"lines":[{"id":38,"person":"Dwight","line":"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, \"Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...\""},{"id":39,"person":"Michael","line":"That would look terrible.

It's not a s*x Ed class."},{"id":59,"person":"Dwight","line":"But I'm right?"},{"id":60,"person":"Michael","line":"Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!"},{"id":61,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?"},{"id":62,"person":"Michael","line":"I do. Both of them."},{"id":63,"person":"Dwight","line":"Could I have a copy of one of them?"},{"id":64,"person":"Michael","line":"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say.

Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it."},{"id":90,"person":"Stanley","line":"Cancel wallpaper."}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":91,"person":"Michael","line":"As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking."},{"id":92,"person":"Pam","line":"You mean Toastmasters?"},{"id":93,"person":"Michael","line":"Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast."},{"id":94,"person":"Pam","line":"Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?"},{"id":95,"person":"Jim","line":"Can I go?"},{"id":96,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative."},{"id":97,"person":"Jim","line":"So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?"},{"id":98,"person":"Kevin","line":"You should go to Hedonism."},{"id":99,"person":"Jim","line":"What is that?"},{"id":100,"person":"Kevin","line":"It's like Club Med, but everything is naked."},{"id":101,"person":"Jim","line":"I was thinking more like Europe.

I am."},{"id":130,"person":"Jim","line":"The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion.

All right!"},{"id":152,"person":"Michael","line":"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?"}]},{"id":33,"lines":[{"id":153,"person":"Kevin","line":"I always set it at 69.

That is a tough crowd."},{"id":163,"person":"Dwight","line":" Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.  how long we have been striving for greatness?  Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight.

"},{"id":174,"person":"Dwight","line":"Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is..."},{"id":175,"person":"Crowd","line":" Together that we prevail! "}]},{"id":40,"lines":[{"id":176,"person":"Pam","line":"Australia?

Something happened?"},{"id":193,"person":"Michael","line":"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35."},{"id":194,"person":"Dwight","line":"Weird."},{"id":195,"person":"Michael","line":"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'"},{"id":196,"person":"Dwight","line":"Con artist."},{"id":197,"person":"Michael","line":"She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse.
