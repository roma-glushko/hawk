And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?"},{"id":98,"person":"Angela","line":"You already did me."},{"id":99,"person":"Michael","line":"That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight.
