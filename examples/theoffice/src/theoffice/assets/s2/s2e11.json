I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up."}]},{"id":31,"lines":[{"id":180,"person":"Roy","line":"Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!"}]},{"id":32,"lines":[{"id":181,"person":"Michael","line":"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?"},{"id":182,"person":"Roy","line":"No, it was Captain Jack."},{"id":183,"person":"Michael","line":"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.

What?"},{"id":199,"person":"Michael","line":"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a..."},{"id":200,"person":"Captain Jack","line":"Hey! Hey!
