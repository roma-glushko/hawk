I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car.

Dude, where's my office?  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers.

I'm done with this."},{"id":47,"person":"Dwight","line":"He sure left in a hurry."}]},{"id":11,"lines":[{"id":48,"person":"Dwight","line":"I don't want to blow this.

Uh-oh, who's in trouble?"}]},{"id":18,"lines":[{"id":85,"person":"Dwight","line":"Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine."},{"id":86,"person":"Michael","line":"Waa... what? What are you talking about?"},{"id":87,"person":"Dwight","line":"Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours."},{"id":88,"person":"Oscar","line":"Is that true, Toby?"},{"id":89,"person":"Toby","line":"Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing."}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":90,"person":"Michael","line":"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it."}]},{"id":20,"lines":[{"id":91,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection."},{"id":92,"person":"Dwight","line":"No you can't do that."},{"id":93,"person":"Michael","line":"I can do that, it is my office."},{"id":94,"person":"Michael","line":"Hmmm.

I promise, I'm not that kind of..."},{"id":101,"person":"Pam","line":"Hey guys, what's going on?"},{"id":102,"person":"Kelly","line":"We're having the best conversation. "},{"id":103,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation.

That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, \"Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.\""},{"id":110,"person":"Dwight","line":"Thank you, Michael."}]},{"id":24,"lines":[{"id":111,"person":"Michael","line":"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind."}]},{"id":25,"lines":[{"id":112,"person":"Michael","line":"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children."},{"id":113,"person":"Stanley","line":"Where did you get these facts?"},{"id":114,"person":"Michael","line":"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?"},{"id":115,"person":"Stanley","line":"They are not."},{"id":116,"person":"Michael","line":"Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?"},{"id":117,"person":"Stanley","line":"No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants."},{"id":118,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?"},{"id":119,"person":"Toby","line":"Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael."},{"id":120,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes it is."},{"id":121,"person":"Toby","line":"No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors."},{"id":122,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair."},{"id":123,"person":"Toby","line":"You can't do that."},{"id":124,"person":"Michael","line":"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly."},{"id":125,"person":"Toby","line":"That's not random."},{"id":126,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam."},{"id":127,"person":"Pam","line":"I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs."},{"id":128,"person":"Michael","line":"Really? "},{"id":129,"person":"Pam","line":"Uh, hmmm."},{"id":130,"person":"Michael","line":"Jim it's okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he's doing it, okay.  It's okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":131,"person":"Pam","line":"Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that."}]},{"id":27,"lines":[{"id":132,"person":"Michael","line":"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not."},{"id":133,"person":"Dwight","line":"No, you will be tested."},{"id":134,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes, I will not be."},{"id":135,"person":"Dwight","line":"You will be. That is the law according to the rules."},{"id":136,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you."}]},{"id":28,"lines":[{"id":137,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.

Just the urine."},{"id":145,"person":"Dwight","line":"That goes directly to the tester."},{"id":146,"person":"Michael","line":"Just. I need your urine."},{"id":147,"person":"Dwight","line":"Like in a cup?"},{"id":148,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight."},{"id":149,"person":"Dwight","line":"For what purpose?"},{"id":150,"person":"Michael","line":"It's none of your business."},{"id":151,"person":"Dwight","line":"Then I refuse."},{"id":152,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring."},{"id":153,"person":"Dwight","line":"Are you serious?"},{"id":154,"person":"Michael","line":"I need clean urine for the lady."},{"id":155,"person":"Dwight","line":"But that's illegal."},{"id":156,"person":"Michael","line":"Don't think of it that way.

It just... goes"},{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":"Not my urine."},{"id":158,"person":"Michael","line":"A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident.
