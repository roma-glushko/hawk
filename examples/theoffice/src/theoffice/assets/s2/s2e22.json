"},{"id":20,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh, my God."}]},{"id":4,"lines":[{"id":21,"person":"Michael","line":"I try not to think of it as lagging behind.

We do that every year."},{"id":40,"person":"Michael","line":"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts."},{"id":41,"person":"Oscar","line":"It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering."},{"id":42,"person":"Michael","line":"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning.

We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna..."},{"id":54,"person":"Toby","line":"Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?"},{"id":55,"person":"Michael","line":"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist.

No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried."}]},{"id":11,"lines":[{"id":69,"person":"Michael","line":"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. \"I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.\"  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams."}]},{"id":12,"lines":[{"id":70,"person":"Jim","line":"What are you doing?"},{"id":71,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, nothing."},{"id":72,"person":"Jim","line":"\"Till Death Do Us Rock.\""},{"id":73,"person":"Pam","line":"They're wedding bands."},{"id":74,"person":"Jim","line":"Oh."},{"id":75,"person":"Pam","line":"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now."},{"id":76,"person":"Jim","line":"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that.
