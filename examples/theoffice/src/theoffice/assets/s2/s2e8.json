We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.

We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?"},{"id":129,"person":"Jan","line":"No."},{"id":130,"person":"Michael","line":"This is a business question.

Number one: \"What should we do to prepare for Y2K?\""},{"id":155,"person":"Dwight","line":"What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"},{"id":156,"person":"Kelly","line":"I thought you read these every week."},{"id":157,"person":"Michael","line":"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally."},{"id":158,"person":"Dwight","line":"It happens occasionally."},{"id":159,"person":"Michael","line":"And, um, one down. Next suggestion: \"we need better outreach for employees fighting depression\". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression."},{"id":160,"person":"Jan","line":"That sounds serious, Michael."},{"id":161,"person":"Michael","line":"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?"},{"id":162,"person":"Dwight","line":"Tom?"},{"id":163,"person":"Michael","line":"Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom."},{"id":164,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.  Tom?

Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody."},{"id":170,"person":"Toby","line":"Aren't the suggestions meant for you?"},{"id":171,"person":"Michael","line":"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words."},{"id":172,"person":"Creed","line":"Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring."},{"id":173,"person":"Michael","line":"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. \"You need to do something about your coffee breath\"-"},{"id":174,"person":"Dwight","line":"You need-"},{"id":175,"person":"Michael","line":"Ok."},{"id":176,"person":"Dwight","line":"To do something about-"},{"id":177,"person":"Michael","line":"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK.

Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.

Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word: dedication.  I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness.  Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays."},{"id":216,"person":"Michael","line":"You do? How do you get in?"},{"id":217,"person":"Dwight","line":"I have a copy of your key."},{"id":218,"person":"Jan","line":"That's a serious offense!"},{"id":219,"person":"Michael","line":"That is a serious offense.
