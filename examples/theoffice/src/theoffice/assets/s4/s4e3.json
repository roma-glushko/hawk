Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person.

Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right.

I did."},{"id":228,"person":"Toby","line":"Technically, he's right."},{"id":229,"person":"Michael","line":"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?"},{"id":230,"person":"Creed","line":"Because they're lame."},{"id":231,"person":"Michael","line":"No, Creed, no they are not.
