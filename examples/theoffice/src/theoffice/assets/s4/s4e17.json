When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay?  Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will -  He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time.

Hey."},{"id":56,"person":"Justin","line":"Hi."},{"id":57,"person":"Michael","line":"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby."},{"id":58,"person":"Justin","line":"Sorry for wasting your time."},{"id":59,"person":"Michael","line":"Oh, no problem.  And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately."},{"id":60,"person":"Darryl","line":"Yeah, the booth is lame without it."},{"id":61,"person":"Pam","line":"I only brought the one."},{"id":62,"person":"Michael","line":"Are you mental?"},{"id":63,"person":"Pam","line":"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, \"Are you sure Michael?\" And you said \"Pam! Pam! Pam!\" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, \"Don't worry, it's just allergies.\" Do you remember that?"},{"id":64,"person":"Michael","line":"I... don't."},{"id":65,"person":"Pam","line":"Okay.

Never mind."}]},{"id":22,"lines":[{"id":87,"person":"Michael","line":" What do you want?"},{"id":88,"person":"Dwight","line":"Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day."},{"id":89,"person":"Michael","line":"Who cares?

Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good."}]},{"id":35,"lines":[{"id":153,"person":"Woman on mic","line":"The job fair will be closing in five minutes.
