I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity."}]},{"id":12,"lines":[{"id":78,"person":"Michael","line":"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old.

I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime."},{"id":89,"person":"David Wallace","line":"This is weird."},{"id":90,"person":"Michael","line":"I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it."},{"id":91,"person":"David Wallace","line":"Okay, I'll see it tomorrow."},{"id":92,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay.
