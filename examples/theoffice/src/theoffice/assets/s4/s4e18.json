We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear.

I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!"},{"id":66,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!"},{"id":67,"person":"Jim","line":"Yes! So when do you start?"},{"id":68,"person":"Pam","line":"I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw \"congratulations\" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack."},{"id":69,"person":"Jim","line":"Wow.

So, strike one, I hate her already."},{"id":82,"person":"Dwight","line":"I hate her too."},{"id":83,"person":"Michael","line":"Why do you hate her?"},{"id":84,"person":"Dwight","line":"Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head."},{"id":85,"person":"Michael","line":"You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me."},{"id":86,"person":"Dwight","line":"Would that be such a bad thing?"},{"id":87,"person":"Michael","line":"Yeah! It would!
