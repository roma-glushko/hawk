That's as clear as I can make it."},{"id":86,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it."},{"id":87,"person":"Michael","line":"Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants.

Is that close enough for you?"},{"id":93,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yes.

He's my nephew."},{"id":96,"person":"All","line":"What?"},{"id":97,"person":"Michael","line":"Luke is my nephew."},{"id":98,"person":"Oscar","line":"Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew."},{"id":99,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing."},{"id":100,"person":"Darryl","line":"What's wrong with a level playing field?"},{"id":101,"person":"Michael","line":"Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe."},{"id":102,"person":"Jim","line":"Oh, man, so many points being made."}]},{"id":22,"lines":[{"id":103,"person":"Creed","line":"I couldn't care less about nepotism.

Jesus Christ, his son."},{"id":105,"person":"Erin","line":"That's a really tight argument."},{"id":106,"person":"Michael","line":"Thank you."},{"id":107,"person":"Jim","line":"But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus."},{"id":108,"person":"Michael","line":"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?"},{"id":109,"person":"Oscar","line":"This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible."},{"id":110,"person":"Michael","line":"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!"},{"id":111,"person":"Kelly","line":"I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you."},{"id":112,"person":"Oscar","line":"If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?"},{"id":113,"person":"Michael","line":"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, \"Wow, he is so great.\" And I was gonna say, \"Well, it's in the genes.\" And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is."},{"id":114,"person":"Erin","line":"Hey! Ice cream afternoon!"},{"id":115,"person":"Michael","line":"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!"},{"id":116,"person":"Kevin","line":"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?"},{"id":117,"person":"Pam","line":"Or enough for everyone?"},{"id":118,"person":"Luke","line":"No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips."},{"id":119,"person":"Oscar","line":"Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips."},{"id":120,"person":"Andy","line":"Clutch cream run, bro."}]},{"id":24,"lines":[{"id":121,"person":"Pam","line":"Get whatever you want, on me."},{"id":122,"person":"Jim","line":"You really think you can make it up to me with food?"},{"id":123,"person":"Pam","line":"I don't know. That usually works."}]},{"id":25,"lines":[{"id":124,"person":"Pam","line":"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":125,"person":"Angela","line":"I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car."},{"id":126,"person":"Michael","line":"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!"},{"id":127,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them."},{"id":128,"person":"Michael","line":"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store."},{"id":129,"person":"Jim","line":"Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, \"I don't own an Ebay store,\" so..."},{"id":130,"person":"Michael","line":"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project."},{"id":131,"person":"Oscar","line":"Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday."},{"id":132,"person":"Stanley","line":"Let's just make this kid open this damn car."},{"id":133,"person":"Erin","line":"Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots."},{"id":134,"person":"Michael","line":"I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway."},{"id":135,"person":"Andy","line":"You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A."},{"id":136,"person":"Michael","line":"Wait a minute."},{"id":137,"person":"Meredith","line":" I'm in."},{"id":138,"person":"Michael","line":"Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony."},{"id":139,"person":"Oscar","line":"Yep, here they are."},{"id":140,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time."},{"id":141,"person":"Andy","line":"This kid's costing us sales, Michael."},{"id":142,"person":"Erin","line":"I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see."},{"id":143,"person":"Michael","line":"No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit."}]},{"id":27,"lines":[{"id":144,"person":"Jo","line":"Why is this my problem, Michael?"},{"id":145,"person":"Michael","line":"Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you."},{"id":146,"person":"Gabe","line":"Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable."},{"id":147,"person":"Jo","line":"Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy."},{"id":148,"person":"Michael","line":"You don't have all the facts."},{"id":149,"person":"Jo","line":"Which are?"},{"id":150,"person":"Michael","line":"I love him."},{"id":151,"person":"Jo","line":"Oh, God. How far has it gone?"},{"id":152,"person":"Michael","line":"No. No. He's my nephew."},{"id":153,"person":"Jo","line":"Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house."},{"id":154,"person":"Michael","line":"Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool."},{"id":155,"person":"Jo","line":"If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities."},{"id":156,"person":"Michael","line":"I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump."},{"id":157,"person":"Jo","line":"Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys."}]},{"id":28,"lines":[{"id":158,"person":"Michael","line":"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other."}]},{"id":29,"lines":[{"id":159,"person":"Kevin","line":"Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff."},{"id":160,"person":"Pam","line":"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses \"Doors closed\" the doors open. Or he presses \"lobby\" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?"},{"id":161,"person":"Kevin","line":"Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board."},{"id":162,"person":"Pam","line":"Dwight is about to get so Pammed."},{"id":163,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hey, did you SMS text message me?"},{"id":164,"person":"Pam","line":"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on."},{"id":165,"person":"Dwight","line":" Okay, that's weird.
