This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber."},{"id":77,"person":"Darryl","line":"No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition."},{"id":78,"person":"Michael","line":"Are you kidding me?"},{"id":79,"person":"Darryl","line":"Shhh.

Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone.
