So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?"},{"id":194,"person":"Jim","line":"Okay!

Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius."},{"id":250,"person":"Michael","line":"That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley.
