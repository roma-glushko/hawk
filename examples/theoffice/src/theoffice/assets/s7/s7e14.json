Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes.

To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it."}]},{"id":13,"lines":[{"id":76,"person":"Michael","line":" If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?"},{"id":77,"person":"Holly","line":"Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian."},{"id":78,"person":"Michael","line":"Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today."},{"id":79,"person":"Holly","line":"Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus."},{"id":80,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, yeah, like a character history.
