Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it."},{"id":67,"person":"Dwight","line":"Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman."},{"id":68,"person":"Trevor","line":"Pass. Next one."},{"id":69,"person":"Dwight","line":"All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?"},{"id":70,"person":"Trevor","line":"No, no and no."},{"id":71,"person":"Dwight","line":"There were only two options."},{"id":72,"person":"Trevor","line":"Checkmate.

Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":137,"person":"Gabor","line":"Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point.

We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos."},{"id":145,"person":"Pam","line":"Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it. I need to work on my mural.

That's interesting. �Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately."},{"id":153,"person":"Jim","line":"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife�"},{"id":154,"person":"David Wallace","line":"Jim, another thing.
