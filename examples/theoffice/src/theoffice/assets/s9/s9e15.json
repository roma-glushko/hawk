I hope as a friend."}]},{"id":4,"lines":[{"id":10,"person":"Pete","line":"Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'.

It's called Bembe. "},{"id":94,"person":"Dwight","line":"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie.

Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?"},{"id":97,"person":"Dwight","line":"No. Please. Come on, Clark.

And then, everything just went numb."},{"id":106,"person":"Jim","line":"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight."},{"id":107,"person":"Brian","line":"Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over.  I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK.  We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other."},{"id":108,"person":"Pam","line":" Yeah."},{"id":109,"person":"Jim","line":"What?"},{"id":110,"person":"Brian","line":"At least my crying won't get you fired."},{"id":111,"person":"Jim","line":"Crying?"}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":112,"person":"Andy","line":"I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account.

I'm impressed."},{"id":117,"person":"Dwight","line":" Yeah!"},{"id":118,"person":"Andy","line":"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight."},{"id":119,"person":"Dwight","line":"You were on a boat."},{"id":120,"person":"Andy","line":"I was..."},{"id":121,"person":"Dwight","line":"On a boat."},{"id":122,"person":"Andy","line":"hat..."},{"id":123,"person":"Dwight","line":"In the ocean."},{"id":124,"person":"Andy","line":"OK.

What do you think you're doing?"},{"id":130,"person":"Andy","line":"Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up."},{"id":131,"person":"Dwight","line":"Don't you dare! Andy!"},{"id":132,"person":"Jan","line":" Hello?"},{"id":133,"person":"Andy","line":"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here."},{"id":134,"person":"Jan","line":"Oh, Andy."},{"id":135,"person":"Andy","line":"I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup."},{"id":136,"person":"Jan","line":"Really?"},{"id":137,"person":"Andy","line":"Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to."},{"id":138,"person":"Jan","line":"Hmm."},{"id":139,"person":"Dwight","line":" Coolio."},{"id":140,"person":"Jan","line":"Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?"},{"id":141,"person":"Dwight","line":"Coolio. Coolio."},{"id":142,"person":"Andy","line":"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood."},{"id":143,"person":"Jan","line":"Yeah."},{"id":144,"person":"Dwight","line":"Coolio."},{"id":145,"person":"Andy","line":"It, it's, it's actually just an issue..."},{"id":146,"person":"Jan","line":"You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option."},{"id":147,"person":"Dwight","line":"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything."},{"id":148,"person":"Andy","line":"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but..."},{"id":149,"person":"Jan","line":"Tell Angela to send me a final invoice."},{"id":150,"person":"Andy","line":"Well, ah, ah..."},{"id":151,"person":"Dwight","line":"Please Ja, Ja...

Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks."},{"id":154,"person":"Angela","line":"Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. "},{"id":155,"person":"Andy","line":"All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Who's that little fella?"},{"id":156,"person":"Angela","line":"It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter."},{"id":157,"person":"Andy","line":"Wow, that's wonderful!"},{"id":158,"person":"Oscar","line":"A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone."},{"id":159,"person":"Andy","line":"Uh-huh."},{"id":160,"person":"Angela","line":"Uh-huh."},{"id":161,"person":"Andy","line":"Uh-huh...  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed."}]},{"id":25,"lines":[{"id":162,"person":"Dwight","line":"Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen."},{"id":163,"person":"Clark","line":" Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week."},{"id":164,"person":"Kevin","line":"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?"},{"id":165,"person":"Dwight","line":"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":166,"person":"Dwight","line":"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf."}]},{"id":27,"lines":[{"id":167,"person":"Nellie","line":"I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?"},{"id":168,"person":"Meredith","line":"Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?"},{"id":169,"person":"Erin","line":"Hey!"},{"id":170,"person":"Pete","line":"Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?"},{"id":171,"person":"Erin","line":"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands."},{"id":172,"person":"Dwight","line":"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway."},{"id":173,"person":"Andy","line":" What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy!  All right. Back to work."}]},{"id":28,"lines":[{"id":174,"person":"Pam","line":"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?"},{"id":175,"person":"Jim","line":"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy."},{"id":176,"person":"Pam","line":"I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress."},{"id":177,"person":"Jim","line":"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you."},{"id":178,"person":"Pam","line":"It's not Brian's fault."},{"id":179,"person":"Jim","line":"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it."},{"id":180,"person":"Pam","line":"OK."}]},{"id":29,"lines":[{"id":181,"person":"Andy","line":"I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip."},{"id":182,"person":"Dwight","line":"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages."},{"id":183,"person":"Andy","line":"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?"},{"id":184,"person":"David Wallace","line":" Hey guys."},{"id":185,"person":"Andy","line":"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do."},{"id":186,"person":"David Wallace","line":"Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers."},{"id":187,"person":"Andy","line":"Thank you."},{"id":188,"person":"David Wallace","line":"Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?"},{"id":189,"person":"Andy","line":"Great!"},{"id":190,"person":"David Wallace","line":" Great job, everybody!"},{"id":191,"person":"Andy","line":" We had to let a warehouse guy go?!"},{"id":192,"person":"Kevin","line":"You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank..."},{"id":193,"person":"Dwight","line":" ... lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy."},{"id":194,"person":"Andy","line":"What?!"},{"id":195,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yeah."},{"id":196,"person":"Andy","line":"There was a fire in the warehouse?"},{"id":197,"person":"Dwight","line":"The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers."},{"id":198,"person":"Kevin","line":"Whoa."},{"id":199,"person":"Andy","line":"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?"},{"id":200,"person":"Phyllis","line":"We started selling balloons."},{"id":201,"person":"Andy","line":"What?!"},{"id":202,"person":"Clark","line":"Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin."},{"id":203,"person":"Andy","line":"No kidding?"},{"id":204,"person":"Clark","line":"Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless."},{"id":205,"person":"Andy","line":"Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50."},{"id":206,"person":"Clark","line":"They're tasteful."},{"id":207,"person":"Andy","line":"Good, good. What else?"}]},{"id":30,"lines":[{"id":208,"person":"Andy","line":"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire."},{"id":209,"person":"David Wallace","line":"What fire?"},{"id":210,"person":"Andy","line":"The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes."},{"id":211,"person":"David Wallace","line":"It looked fine to me."},{"id":212,"person":"Andy","line":" I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire."},{"id":213,"person":"David Wallace","line":"OK."},{"id":214,"person":"Andy","line":"I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well."}]},{"id":31,"lines":[{"id":215,"person":"David Wallace","line":" Thanks, Andy."},{"id":216,"person":"Andy","line":"Thank you."},{"id":217,"person":"David Wallace","line":"All right.

You think I need a new fish?"},{"id":222,"person":"Erin","line":"I don't love you anymore."},{"id":223,"person":"Andy","line":"What?"},{"id":224,"person":"Erin","line":"I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you."},{"id":225,"person":"Andy","line":"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here."},{"id":226,"person":"Erin","line":"I just said there isn't love."},{"id":227,"person":"Andy","line":"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time."},{"id":228,"person":"Erin","line":"I guess."},{"id":229,"person":"Andy","line":"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky.
