I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim.

Can you just fill out the form please?"},{"id":38,"person":"Meredith","line":"Yes."}]},{"id":15,"lines":[{"id":39,"person":"Pam","line":"I'm sure she's just confused.

We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault."},{"id":56,"person":"Oscar","line":"Pam, really? Come on."},{"id":57,"person":"Meredith","line":"Hey, what do you want? I know who I am.

That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free?  Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?"},{"id":67,"person":"Nellie","line":"No."},{"id":68,"person":"Kevin","line":"No."},{"id":69,"person":"Dwight","line":"Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch."}]},{"id":21,"lines":[{"id":70,"person":"Darryl","line":"Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules.

We just broke up."},{"id":71,"person":"Phyllis","line":"You got dumped?"},{"id":72,"person":"Darryl","line":"Yeah, she ended things."},{"id":73,"person":"Nellie","line":"Breakups are the worst.

There's a pencil broken in my rolls."}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":84,"person":"Pam","line":"Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me."}]},{"id":24,"lines":[{"id":85,"person":"Jim","line":"Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?"},{"id":86,"person":"Limo Driver","line":"Yeah, take some home if you want."},{"id":87,"person":"Jim","line":"Oh no, no, no. That's ok.  Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?"},{"id":88,"person":"Limo Driver","line":"No, Mr. Irving called.

Getting rid of the lice."},{"id":94,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh stop! I am so sorry!"},{"id":95,"person":"Meredith","line":"Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?"},{"id":96,"person":"Pam","line":"Nothing."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":97,"person":"Pam","line":"I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this."}]},{"id":27,"lines":[{"id":98,"person":"Dwight","line":"Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!"},{"id":99,"person":"Erin","line":"No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats..."},{"id":100,"person":"Dwight","line":"To be burned!"},{"id":101,"person":"Erin","line":"To be washed."},{"id":102,"person":"Angela","line":"What do we do about our heads?"},{"id":103,"person":"Dwight","line":"I'm not gonna lie. Lye!"},{"id":104,"person":"Erin","line":"No, all we need is mayonnaise."},{"id":105,"person":"Angela","line":"Excuse me?"},{"id":106,"person":"Pam","line":"She's right, it works. I would imagine."},{"id":107,"person":"Erin","line":"Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos."},{"id":108,"person":"Oscar","line":"I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce."},{"id":109,"person":"Meredith","line":" Shaboom! How do you like me now!?"},{"id":110,"person":"Angela","line":"Oh."},{"id":111,"person":"Oscar","line":"Wow."},{"id":112,"person":"Meredith","line":"Take a picture. It will last longer."},{"id":113,"person":"Angela","line":"We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible."},{"id":114,"person":"Creed","line":"Bald people make me sick."},{"id":115,"person":"Meredith","line":"Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss."},{"id":116,"person":"Erin","line":"Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now."},{"id":117,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh! Uh, uh I'll go."},{"id":118,"person":"Angela","line":"Okay. Oh, thank you."},{"id":119,"person":"Oscar","line":"You're a saint, Pam."},{"id":120,"person":"Pam","line":"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?"},{"id":121,"person":"Meredith","line":"Thanks Pam!

I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other."},{"id":127,"person":"Darryl","line":"Yeah."},{"id":128,"person":"Phyllis","line":"What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?"},{"id":129,"person":"Darryl","line":"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head."},{"id":130,"person":"Nellie","line":"Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this."},{"id":131,"person":"Kevin","line":"I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake."},{"id":132,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake."},{"id":133,"person":"Nellie","line":"Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most."},{"id":134,"person":"Kevin","line":"An Escalade."},{"id":135,"person":"Nellie","line":"Or what's her name."},{"id":136,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Val."},{"id":137,"person":"Nellie","line":"Let's get Darryl Val."}]},{"id":29,"lines":[{"id":138,"person":"Julius Irving","line":"I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here.

Wow, Halpert's got game."},{"id":143,"person":"Jim","line":"Alright.  Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?"},{"id":144,"person":"Julius","line":"It's your wife? You better take it."},{"id":145,"person":"Jim","line":"Right!  Hey, what's up? Everything ok?"},{"id":146,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, no everything's great!

What do you think?"},{"id":153,"person":"Jim","line":"I love it."}]},{"id":30,"lines":[{"id":154,"person":"Erin","line":" Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away."},{"id":155,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. "},{"id":156,"person":"Stanley","line":"Put those away before you hurt yourself."},{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":" Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No!

Is that all?"},{"id":182,"person":"Nellie","line":"No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?"},{"id":183,"person":"Val","line":"Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?"},{"id":184,"person":"Kevin","line":"So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?"},{"id":185,"person":"Val","line":"No."},{"id":186,"person":"Kevin","line":"Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town?

Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. "},{"id":207,"person":"Erin","line":"Wow.
