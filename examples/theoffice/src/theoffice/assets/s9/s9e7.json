Uh huh."},{"id":128,"person":"Dwight","line":"What are you doing?"},{"id":129,"person":"Pam","line":"A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you.

I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face.

It's hopeless."}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":149,"person":"Pam","line":"Ten years ago, I didn't care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft.

Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?"},{"id":153,"person":"Dwight","line":"I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently."},{"id":154,"person":"Pam","line":"Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber."},{"id":155,"person":"Dwight","line":"Okay, I can do that."},{"id":156,"person":"Pam","line":"Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps."},{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":"He used to fight dogs."},{"id":158,"person":"Pam","line":"Like, he used to make dogs fight?
