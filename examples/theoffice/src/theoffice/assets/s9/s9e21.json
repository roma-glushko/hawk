Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important.

In his words, \"The kind that's good for head shots.\" And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it's gonna boost office morale. Now, he's a good guy.

I get it."}]},{"id":18,"lines":[{"id":88,"person":"Andy","line":"The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel, that's chick stuff.

And I thought you wanted that job."},{"id":122,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager."}]},{"id":27,"lines":[{"id":123,"person":"David Wallace","line":"So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on."},{"id":124,"person":"Jim","line":"Again."},{"id":125,"person":"David Wallace","line":"Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?"},{"id":126,"person":"Jim","line":"Not at all.

You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive."},{"id":134,"person":"Andy","line":"Yeah, sure. What's your question?"},{"id":135,"person":"Kevin","line":"Our question is�it seems dumb."},{"id":136,"person":"Andy","line":"Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?"},{"id":137,"person":"Nellie","line":"Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and \"full-ass\" it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?"},{"id":138,"person":"Andy","line":"Nah. I like my plan better."},{"id":139,"person":"Kevin","line":"Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor."},{"id":140,"person":"Andy","line":"What?"}]},{"id":29,"lines":[{"id":141,"person":"Oscar","line":"No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?"}]},{"id":30,"lines":[{"id":142,"person":"Jim","line":"Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?"},{"id":143,"person":"Pam","line":"Yes. Yeah."},{"id":144,"person":"Jim","line":"I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens."},{"id":145,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh, boy.

Oh, wow. You have that."},{"id":151,"person":"Pam","line":"Mm-hmm."},{"id":152,"person":"Jim","line":"Wow, that's�"},{"id":153,"person":"Pam","line":"It's all yours."},{"id":154,"person":"Jim","line":"You come so prepared. Aspirin."},{"id":155,"person":"Dwight","line":"You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that."},{"id":156,"person":"Jim","line":"Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great."},{"id":157,"person":"Dwight","line":"Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?"},{"id":158,"person":"Jim","line":"No. He was maybe thinking of you for it."},{"id":159,"person":"Dwight","line":"Yeah, right.

Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!"},{"id":169,"person":"Dwight","line":"This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings."},{"id":170,"person":"Andy","line":"Thank you, I appreciate that. �Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it."},{"id":171,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?"},{"id":172,"person":"Andy","line":"No, I just applied for more overdraft protection."},{"id":173,"person":"Dwight","line":"Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job."},{"id":174,"person":"Andy","line":" Nothing is impossible to him who will try.

Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve."},{"id":181,"person":"Andy","line":"Thank you.
