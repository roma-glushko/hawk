So there'll be a bunch of kids."},{"id":14,"person":"Angela","line":"No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew.

He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?"},{"id":32,"person":"Darryl","line":"I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to  soak... He hooked me up with a job."}]},{"id":13,"lines":[{"id":33,"person":"Pam","line":" Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice."}]},{"id":14,"lines":[{"id":34,"person":"Pam","line":"I don't demand justice often.

It's 6782 not 83."},{"id":54,"person":"Creed","line":"Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage."},{"id":55,"person":"Oscar","line":"Pam, what can be done?"},{"id":56,"person":"Pam","line":"Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question."},{"id":57,"person":"Oscar","line":"I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear."},{"id":58,"person":"Pam","line":"What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing."},{"id":59,"person":"Phyllis","line":"David Wallace called this meeting?"},{"id":60,"person":"Pam","line":"Sure did.

Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him."},{"id":92,"person":"Dwight","line":"We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying.

We're good friends. Good friends."},{"id":157,"person":"Oscar","line":"Yeah."},{"id":158,"person":"Senator","line":"You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am.  I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego.  Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar.  My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar.
