No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right?

That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim."}]},{"id":31,"lines":[{"id":151,"person":"Dwight","line":"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed.

Are you going to discipline him or not?"},{"id":158,"person":"Michael","line":"Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys.
