Uh, you're foir-ed.\" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way.

Just fudge the numbers.\" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there.
