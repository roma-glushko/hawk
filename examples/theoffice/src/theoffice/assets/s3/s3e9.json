Now."}]},{"id":3,"lines":[{"id":16,"person":"Jim","line":"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet."}]},{"id":4,"lines":[{"id":17,"person":"Michael","line":"Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know."},{"id":18,"person":"Angela","line":"Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting."},{"id":19,"person":"Jan","line":" Mmhmm."},{"id":20,"person":"Angela","line":"Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means."},{"id":21,"person":"Jan","line":"We get that money for hiring an ex-convict."},{"id":22,"person":"Michael","line":"I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding."},{"id":23,"person":"Jan","line":"When did the check come?"},{"id":24,"person":"Angela","line":"Last week."},{"id":25,"person":"Jan","line":"Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program.

Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake."}]},{"id":6,"lines":[{"id":46,"person":"Kevin","line":"I wonder what he did."},{"id":47,"person":"Michael","line":"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened."},{"id":48,"person":"Pam","line":"Why would anyone go to jail for that?"},{"id":49,"person":"Michael","line":"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people."},{"id":50,"person":"Kevin","line":"Cool."},{"id":51,"person":"Pam","line":"Okay. Angela?"},{"id":52,"person":"Angela","line":"Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace.

Where I went to college. I live to frolf."},{"id":78,"person":"Jim","line":"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it.

Getting settled, you know?"},{"id":81,"person":"Michael","line":"Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam.

Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you."}]},{"id":15,"lines":[{"id":93,"person":"Martin","line":"So... you all wanna know what I was in for?"},{"id":94,"person":"Michael","line":"No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them."},{"id":95,"person":"Martin","line":"Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading.

There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So.

Both of you."},{"id":177,"person":"Martin","line":"Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television.
