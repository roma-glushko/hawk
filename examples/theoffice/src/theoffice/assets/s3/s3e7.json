This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like \"Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.\" It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't.
