And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.

When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone."},{"id":129,"person":"Roy","line":"Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car."},{"id":130,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, fine. Hurry back."},{"id":131,"person":"Roy","line":" There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the \"grief counseling\" session."},{"id":132,"person":"Pam","line":"Oh. I would like a break."}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":133,"person":"Roy","line":"How are you likin' the new car?"},{"id":134,"person":"Pam","line":"Great."},{"id":135,"person":"Roy","line":"Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?"},{"id":136,"person":"Pam","line":"I think so.

Yeah."}]},{"id":20,"lines":[{"id":138,"person":"Jim","line":" Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market.

Wait, no. I'll call you back.  Shut up ."},{"id":139,"person":"Karen","line":" Six?"}]},{"id":21,"lines":[{"id":140,"person":"Michael","line":" Okay, we can start. Um..."},{"id":141,"person":"Pam","line":"You waited for me?"},{"id":142,"person":"Michael","line":"Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?"},{"id":143,"person":"Dwight","line":" I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby."},{"id":144,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else."},{"id":145,"person":"Stanley","line":" Nope."},{"id":146,"person":"Michael","line":" Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go."},{"id":147,"person":"Stanley","line":"I will NOT. "},{"id":148,"person":"Michael","line":"Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam."},{"id":149,"person":"Pam","line":"Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die."},{"id":150,"person":"Michael","line":"Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay."},{"id":151,"person":"Ryan","line":" Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened."},{"id":152,"person":"Michael","line":"Do you want to talk about it anymore?"},{"id":153,"person":"Ryan","line":"Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story."},{"id":154,"person":"Kevin","line":"Me, me, me, me, me me.  Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so..."},{"id":155,"person":"Michael","line":"Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game?"},{"id":156,"person":"Phyllis","line":"Well, there is a ball."},{"id":157,"person":"Michael","line":"All right, we're starting over."},{"id":158,"person":"Stanley","line":"No, I'm done."},{"id":159,"person":"Michael","line":"You are not leaving. No! We are not done."},{"id":160,"person":"Angela","line":"We really have a lot of work to do right now."},{"id":161,"person":"Michael","line":"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. "},{"id":162,"person":"Toby","line":"Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going."},{"id":163,"person":"Michael","line":"How do you know?"},{"id":164,"person":"Toby","line":"What?"},{"id":165,"person":"Michael","line":"That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?"},{"id":166,"person":"Toby","line":"It was obvious..."},{"id":167,"person":"Michael","line":"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't.

That was SO funny."},{"id":224,"person":"Pam","line":"And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid.
