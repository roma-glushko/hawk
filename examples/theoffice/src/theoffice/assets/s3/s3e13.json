You're going to sit in the back?"},{"id":78,"person":"Dwight","line":"Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car.

Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment."},{"id":83,"person":"Andy","line":"Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder."}]},{"id":14,"lines":[{"id":84,"person":"Angela","line":"Hey Pam.

It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?"},{"id":99,"person":"Michael","line":"Hawkman."}]},{"id":19,"lines":[{"id":100,"person":"Andy","line":"My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons."},{"id":101,"person":"Michael","line":" Let's go. The men's room was disgusting."}]},{"id":20,"lines":[{"id":102,"person":"Jim","line":"After you sir."},{"id":103,"person":"Dwight","line":"No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear."},{"id":104,"person":"Jim","line":"Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front."},{"id":105,"person":"Dwight","line":"Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... "}]},{"id":21,"lines":[{"id":106,"person":"Pam","line":"Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time."},{"id":107,"person":"Angela","line":"This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot."},{"id":108,"person":"Pam","line":"That's great."},{"id":109,"person":"Angela","line":"Yes, it is.  Hello?"}]},{"id":22,"lines":[{"id":110,"person":"Michael","line":"Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?"},{"id":111,"person":"Buyer","line":"Yep."},{"id":112,"person":"Michael","line":"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big."},{"id":113,"person":"Andy","line":"Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once."},{"id":114,"person":"Michael","line":"You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency."},{"id":115,"person":"Andy","line":"Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York."},{"id":116,"person":"Buyer","line":"Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past."},{"id":117,"person":"Michael","line":"I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company."},{"id":118,"person":"Andy","line":"Oh, man, that is, like, poetry."},{"id":119,"person":"Michael","line":"No."},{"id":120,"person":"Andy","line":"I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree."},{"id":121,"person":"Michael","line":"Stop it.  Stop it."},{"id":122,"person":"Andy","line":"Ow."}]},{"id":23,"lines":[{"id":123,"person":"Pam","line":"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  This is Pam. I did?"}]},{"id":24,"lines":[{"id":124,"person":"Andy","line":"Oh man. Talk about your classic \"Lame dash O.\" Do we even want that guy buying our paper?"},{"id":125,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes."}]},{"id":25,"lines":[{"id":126,"person":"Andy","line":"I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up."},{"id":127,"person":"Michael","line":"Ah, no. Don't worry about it."},{"id":128,"person":"Andy","line":"I really 'Schruted' it."},{"id":129,"person":"Michael","line":"What?"},{"id":130,"person":"Andy","line":"'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?"},{"id":131,"person":"Michael","line":"I don't know. Who knows how words are formed."}]},{"id":26,"lines":[{"id":132,"person":"Phyllis","line":"It's a big order.

They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils.

You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!"}]},{"id":32,"lines":[{"id":166,"person":"Man","line":"We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys."},{"id":167,"person":"Dwight","line":"Sure."},{"id":168,"person":"Jim","line":"Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something.

I won an art contest."},{"id":180,"person":"Angela","line":"That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what?

Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?"},{"id":198,"person":"Michael","line":"No, you are remembering it wrong."}]},{"id":36,"lines":[{"id":199,"person":"Michael","line":"Dwight betrayed me once before.

Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me.
