I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything?

Angela from accounting told me what you did."},{"id":161,"person":"Dwight","line":"Oh my God, she told you?"},{"id":162,"person":"Michael","line":"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize."},{"id":163,"person":"Dwight","line":"Accepted."},{"id":164,"person":"Michael","line":"How's this place treating you?"},{"id":165,"person":"Dwight","line":" The boss isn't funny."},{"id":166,"person":"Michael","line":"Oh, well."},{"id":167,"person":"Dwight","line":"I don't get to wear my ties."},{"id":168,"person":"Michael","line":"No. I'm sure."},{"id":169,"person":"Dwight","line":"So?"},{"id":170,"person":"Michael","line":"So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please."},{"id":171,"person":"Dwight","line":"I don't want to do your laundry anymore."},{"id":172,"person":"Michael","line":"We can talk about that.

"}]},{"id":43,"lines":[{"id":200,"person":"Michael","line":"It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something.

Hmm."}]},{"id":44,"lines":[{"id":201,"person":"Andy","line":"So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so."},{"id":202,"person":"Marcy","line":"Oh, hi. You must be Andy."},{"id":203,"person":"Andy","line":"Oh, hi! Yes.
