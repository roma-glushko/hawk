# Hawk: Debug & Profile

A lightweight debugging & profiling toolkit for production üêç Python microservices.

Hawk is inspired by Go's `net/http/pprof` & `expvars` packages and 
OpenTelemetry Collector's ZPages which are in turn stemmed from Google's internal practices around
debugging production services.
